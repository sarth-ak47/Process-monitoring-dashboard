# Process-monitoring-dashboard
The following Python program is a Real-Time System Performance Dashboard, which has been implemented using Dash and Plotly, to keep a close eye on important system metrics like - CPU, memory, disk, and network usage. One of the main highlights of this dashboard is dynamic data collecting that is completed with the application of the psutil library, and the data is updated every 2 seconds using all the dcc.Interval process. Besides, the dashboard is an interactive platform with the best visual elements like line charts, pie charts, histograms and scatter plots, and bar graphs, and a sortable running-process list. The "More" button lets users expand the process list while the interface is designed with a dark theme so that it can be easily read.
